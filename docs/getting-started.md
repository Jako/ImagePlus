## Create a new template variable

Once Image+ is installed, you can create template variables [TV] in the usual
way, but instead of setting the **Input Type** in the Input Options to *Image*,
choose *Image+* instead.

For most use cases, you should also set the **Output Type** in the Output
Options to *Image+*. This allows you to control the image output on a resource.

## The cropping tool

When using an *Image+* TV, you can select an image in the same way as you would
with a regular *Image* TV. Once an image is selected, a cropping window will
appear where you can select the area of the image to use. The original image is
not changed. So you can upload a single image and reuse it in multiple places on
the website at different sizes (and crops with multiple Image+ TVs).

If you want to change the cropping area, you need to click the crop trigger of
the Image+ TV.

In the cropping window you need to drag the handles of the dotted box to change
the cropping area. If the TV has been configured with size constraints or an
aspect ratio, the cropping area will be limited to that aspect ratio.
