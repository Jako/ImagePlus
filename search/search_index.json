If both values are set, the target aspect ratio\nof the output image is calculated with this values. Both fields have to be\nfilled with an integer value.\n\n\nTarget Aspect Ratio\n\n\nThe aspect ratio for the output image could be restricted with \nTarget Aspect\nRatio\n. If target height and target width are set, this value is ignored and\nthe calculated aspect ratio of target height and target width is used.

So\nsay you want to all your crops to have the same aspect ratio as a \n1600x1000\n\nimage, simply divide \n1600\n by \n1000\n, resulting in \n1.6\n.

It could be output alongside the image\ni.e. as an alt-tag or title-tag.\n\n\nIn order to output the alt text in a \nImage+\n TV placeholder, you will need to\nselect an chunk in the \nOutput Options\n. You could also use the ImagePlus\nsnippet and specify a template chunk in the snippet call options.
